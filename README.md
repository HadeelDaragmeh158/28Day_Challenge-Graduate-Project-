## RELATED EXISTING SYSTEMS
### Introduction:
If you want to develop a new system, it is necessary to look at similar applications and know their weakness and 
strength to avoid weaknesses in your system. During our development process, we did our search to find out what 
are the existing systems that are related to our project to avoid their mistakes and improve the functionalities.
So an overview of some related existing systems will be enlightened in section 2.2. Overall problems and the 
solution approach will be further described in sections 2.3 and 2.4. Lastly, a summary is presented in section 2.5.
### Existing System:
This step is considered to be one of the Elicitation Techniques for gathering data that will help us in writing the 
requirements; weâ€™ll talk about this step in detail in chapter 3. However, for now, we will mention some of the 
similar existing systems that will help us see what features already exist and what features are missing and need 
to be added to this type of website.

### Overall Problems of Existing System:
1- Menu start is complicated.
2- The applications are limited to include just one challenge.
3- If you want to create a custom challenge you need to pay.
4- There is no registration option which means each user has no account to communicate with the admin to 
inquiry about what he wants.
5- Each challenge has limited minutes to practice the required task.
6- Nothing inspires the users or gets them excited to execute the required task or remind them to do it.
### Overall Solution Approach:
1- Add a lot of features, one of them is simplicity.
2- Provide more than one challenge in the application and the user can create his challenge.
3- Support challenges that have the same goal with fitness such as no junk food challenge
4- Each user has one day to do his task and he isn't limited in time.
5- Provide free challenges and features.

6- Support registration option so each user has his account.
7- Enable notifications and choose the time to be notified to remind the user to do the challenge.
#### Summary:
In this chapter, we introduced an existing system that is related to our project which has been taken into 
consideration to avoid its weak points and improve its strong points, and we proposed our solution approaches to 
make a new useful system
